## Objective

Enable local execution of machine learning models while employing the XRPL blockchain network as the exclusive verification authority. ZeroEnter assures that sensitive user data is processed locally, with only the outcomes verified on the blockchain, thereby preserving data sanctity and confidentiality.

---

## Key Features

1. **Deep Integration with XRPL Blockchain**: ZeroEnter has been intricately designed within the XRPL hooks source code. Implementing basic functionality, it integrates the libsnark basic function via the c++ library (libsnark_verify) and offers a proof of concept for ML Zero-Knowledge (ZK) verification (ezkl_verify).

2. **Local ML Model Execution**: Ensures the highest degree of user data protection by executing machine learning models locally, eliminating external exposure risks.

3. **Blockchain Verification**: Following local execution, results undergo verification on the XRPL network through zero-knowledge proofs, guaranteeing data integrity without revealing its essence.

4. **User-Centric Privacy**: Prioritizes user data privacy, ensuring processed data remains local.

5. **Advanced Security Protocols**: Seamless integration into the XRPL hooks source code, fortified with a local-to-blockchain verification mechanism.

---

## Benefits

- **Inherent Local Trust**: Promises local execution of ML processes, ensuring data sanctity.

- **Global XRPL Verification**: Synchronizes with the XRPL network to provide global verification of locally processed outcomes.

- **Pioneering in Compliance**: Echoes global data privacy norms, enhancing regulatory compliance for XRPL-based entities.

- **Optimized Performance**: Capitalizes on local resources and XRPL's verification framework for unmatched efficiency.

---

## Target Audience

- **Financial Institutions**: Entities on the XRPL network seeking advanced methods for data processing and verification.

- **XRPL Blockchain Developers**: Enthusiasts aiming to amalgamate local data processing with XRPL's blockchain verification attributes.

- **Healthcare Institutions on XRPL**: Endeavoring to locally interpret patient diagnostics and validate findings on a trusted blockchain.

- **Data Privacy Advocates & Regulatory Entities**: Championing stringent data protection measures within blockchain paradigms.
